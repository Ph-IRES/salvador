## Review data handling

Working in `data_wrangling_vis_salvador_ordination_rarefaction.R`

Notes:
* All `data_vegan*` tibbles are made from data where taxa not identified to species were removed

Changes:
* I commented out all of the `attach` lines
	* Upon reviewing the function of `attach` we should involk it just prior to running code that uses it, then involk `detach` when we no longer need the data to be attached.  this will prevent interference between different versions of the vegan data tibbles
	* https://statisticsglobe.com/r-warning-the-following-objects-are-masked

## Review NMDS Ordination

* The CAG_17 data point was breaking the code.  I fixed it to uniformly remove CAG_17 from the NMDS
	* CAG_17 was much different along NMDS axis 1, way out on the positive side
* I added ellipses around each of the four treatment combos and matched dashed lines with points with no fill
	* Cag: dashed lines, empty triangles
	* Tub: solid lines, filled circles
	* Ellipses represent the 95% confidence interval based on a multivariate t distribution
		* Update methods to reflect this

## Review hypothesis testing with fixed/mixed models

## Find Data

* Trying `data_wrangling_vis.R`
	* cleaned up some irrelvant, commented-out code
	* copied modifications to `data_all` up to the #### COMBINE DATA #### section
	* I left some code on lines 169-173 to control colors in plots
	* #### CHECK DATA INTEGRITY ####
		* There is one duplicated row of data, I modified the creation of `data` to only keep max_n and then remove any duplicates
		* All of the taxon names were unique, but I noticed that the synonimization of Serranidae and Epinephelidae was not making it into all of our figures and analyses, so I moved that code up to the creation of `data` so that everything downstream will have that change
		* I also created the `taxon` column in the creation of `data` for the same reasons
	* #### PREP DATA FOR VEGAN ####
		* I updated this code to reflect the changes made to `data` and the input from Rene on how to handle duplicates and that they should not exist in the max_n data
		* note in the `data_vegan.env` i included `survey_length_hrs` which will probably have an effect on our results and this should be investigated
		* also included `study_locations`
	* #### Mikaela's Data CleanUp and Modifications ####
		* these modifications to `data_all` were moved to the beginning of the script, so I commented this code out
	* #### Mikaela's Data Visualization ####
		* I added a second histogram to represent that the max_n are summed within an op_code
		* #Barplot of MaxN per BRUV Station at TRNP and Cagayancillo
			* I fixed this code so that max_n is summed within op_code, then mean is taken across op_codes
			* we want to know how many values are used to calculate each mean (the n for each bar)
		* #Faceted Barplot of MaxN at TRNP and Cagayancillo faceted by family 
			* I fixed this code so that max_n is summed within unique combinations of family and op_code, then the mean is taken across op_codes for each family
			* A potential problem I see here is the potential that we are missing zeros.  If a family is not observed in an op_code, it should be recorded as a zero, no? and that zero should contribute to the mean?  Otherwise we are inflating the means by ignoring zeros
		* #Faceted Barplot of MaxN at TRNP and Cagayancillo faceted by family, INCLUDING ZEROS
			* I made this to include zeros in the calculation of the mean sum max n values by family
			* This is the comamand that adds the zeros https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/complete.html
	* #### PERMANOVA W ADONIS2 ####
		* confirmed that this is working with data_vegan and data_vegan.env
